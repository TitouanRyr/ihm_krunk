## About This Project

This Human-Machine Interface (HMI) project has been developed to facilitate the control of a Robot Operating System (ROS) environment comprising three essential packages. The primary modules include dedicated ones for Lidar (pf_lidar_ros_driver) and cameras (pylon-ros-camera and dragandbot_common).

The HMI provides an intuitive user interface to easily manage the nodes associated with the instruments, offering complete control over the hardware components of the system. Basic functionalities include launching and stopping nodes, while advanced options enable control over automatic and manual acquisitions.

## Features

- Launching and stopping nodes for Lidar and cameras.
- Control over automatic acquisitions.
- Manual acquisitions.

## Future Enhancements

The project is designed to evolve with the integration of advanced features, such as:

- Dynamic display of 3D curves generated by Lidar.
- Real-time visual feedback of images captured during automatic acquisitions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository in the `src` folder of your ROS workspace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TitouanRyr/ihm_krunk
```

**Build the workspace:**  
```
cd <path/to/workspace>
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
```
use `catkin_make`:
```
catkin_make
source <path/to/workspace>/install/setup.bash
```
## Usage
This Human-Machine Interface (HMI) project simplifies the control of a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment consisting of three main packages: pf_lidar_ros_driver (Lidar) and two camera-related packages (pylon-ros-camera and dragandbot_common).

### Launching the HMI
To start the HMI, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
roslaunch ihm_krunk start_ihm.launch
```
### Control of Instrumentation Nodes
- The **ON** button launches the instrumentations nodes.
- The **OFF** button stops the instrumentation nodes.

### Control of Automatic Acquisitions
- The **Play** button initiates the automatic acquisition of Lidar and camera, saving a 1-second rosbag file in the **'ihm_krunk/src/acquisitions/acquisition_globale'** directory.
- The **Stop** button halts the automatic acquisition.

### Control of Manual Acquisitions
- The **Lidar** button performs a single Lidar acquisition, saving a 1-second rosbag file in the **'ihm_krunk/src/acquisitions/acquisition_r2000'** directory.
- The **Camera** button performs a single camera acquisition, saving a 1-second rosbag file in the **'ihm_krunk/src/acquisitions/acquisition_camera'** directory.

### Settings (Future Update)
The **Settings** button is reserved for future updates, allowing direct modification of instrumentation parameters from the HMI.

### Feedback
Feedback is displayed directly in the top panel of the HMI. The other two panels are currently under development and will be dedicated to Lidar mapping and camera video feedback.

Feel free to explore the features and contribute to the evolution of this HMI project.
