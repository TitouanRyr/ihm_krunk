# Project Name

## About This Project

This Human-Machine Interface (HMI) project has been developed to facilitate the control of a Robot Operating System (ROS) environment comprising three essential packages. The primary modules include dedicated ones for Lidar (pf_lidar_ros_driver) and cameras (pylon-ros-camera and dragandbot_common).

The HMI provides an intuitive user interface to easily manage the nodes associated with the instruments, offering complete control over the hardware components of the system. Basic functionalities include launching and stopping nodes, while advanced options enable control over automatic and manual acquisitions.

## Features

- Launching and stopping nodes for Lidar and cameras.
- Control over automatic acquisitions.
- Manual acquisitions.

## Future Enhancements

The project is designed to evolve with the integration of advanced features, such as:

- Dynamic display of 3D curves generated by Lidar.
- Real-time visual feedback of images captured during automatic acquisitions.
